# Summary
The Adidas Sales & Profit Analysis Report is built upon a structured data analysis workflow involving data cleaning, transformation, and visualization. Using pivot tables, pivot charts, and slicers, the dataset was explored to uncover trends and performance metrics across products, regions, retailers, and time periods. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, units sold, average transaction value, and profit margin were calculated to assess business health. Descriptive analytics revealed that men’s street footwear was the top-performing category in both sales and profitability. Retailer-wise segmentation identified West Gear and Foot Locker as high-value partners, while regional analysis highlighted the West as the most lucrative market. Time series analysis showed seasonal peaks in July and August. Despite a strong overall profit margin of 36.91%, the low profit per unit suggests opportunities for cost optimization. These insights, derived through interactive dashboards and data aggregation techniques, support strategic decision-making in product development, pricing, and market expansion.
